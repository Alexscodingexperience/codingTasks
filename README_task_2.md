# Task 2 codes 

## file_cd

This file is a script that creates 3 folders, gives commands to create 3 folders inside one of the folders and delete the other 2

## ifExample

This file is also a script and it uses an if statement and it creates a new folder called if_folder if one of the folders created is called new_folder, it also has an if else statement that makes a new folder called hyperionDev if an if folder exists or else it creates a new folder called new-projects

both of these projects are specific to windows and would need different codes on a Mac. Scripts are important in coding because they facilitate automation, efficiency, and reusability, enabling developers to streamline workflows, automate repetitive tasks, and quickly prototype solutions and if statements are important in coding as they allow the execution of specific code blocks based on conditional logic. 

## hello_world.py

This file uses psuedo code, this is used for simple comunication of what the code is doing, great for teaching purposes or creating clarity in code, it also asks the users name and age and prints it back to them and then prints "Hello world"

## details_py

Again this file uses psuedo code and the input() function to collect user information, this function is great for gaining information from a user, it also prints using the short-hand for formatiing - print(f"{}") to display the users input back to them

## conversion.py

This file shows different ways to display numbers, integers, float and string and then prints the numbers back to the user, it is important to know all of these ways to display numbers back to the user so they can get the acurate number they are looking for.
