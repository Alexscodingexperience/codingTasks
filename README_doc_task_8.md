# doc_task Folder (Task 8)

## doc_tasks folder

This folder has both txt documents and python documents, the python documents code creates the folders using open() function - this function allows you to read, write and append folders, this is more advanced code, it is important to know this code as companies use multiple files in one code usually.

## doc_task.py and DOB.txt

These two folders are linked, the doc_task.py code opens the DOB.txt file and then displays the names in one section and then the date of births in another section. this uses the open() funtion with 'r' which means read, reading the documents within the file DOB.txt

##  student_register.py and reg_form.txt

These two folders are also linked, the student_register.py created the reg_form.txt document, it allows the user to register students to an exam using the students ID's. this uses the funtion open() with 'w' which writes the file, it is important to be careful when using 'w' as this will overwrite previous details in the file.
