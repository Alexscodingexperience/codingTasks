# Task 6 codes

## holiday.py

In this file, the code gives the user a few options of holiday destinations, depending on the destination, the price differs, this is done using an if statement, the code also asks the number of nights a user will stay and how many days they will rent a car and gives the price for this as well using a define key word, the define key word is usual to give a cost for something, finally it gives the price of the total cost of the holiday by adding all three strings together. This code is important to calculate total costs when there are multiple costs that need adding together.
