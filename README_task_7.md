# Task 7 codes

## alternative.py

In this file, the code asks the user to enter a sentance, the code will then print the result in alternative upper and lower case letters, it then asks the user to enter another sentence, this time the words are alternativly changing from upper to lower case. upper and lower case words can be good to use for creating important documents, for example, passport documents, if a user enters their name fully in lower case, the outcome can be corrected so the first letter of the persons name is in uppercase.

## cafe.py

This code shows the stock value of a cafe, it adds together the value of the amount of stock in the menu and the total cost of these items and then calculates everything. It is important to know this code when working with retail stores as they should always have an up-to-date stock inventory, this code uses the for loop to then times together the price and number of items.
